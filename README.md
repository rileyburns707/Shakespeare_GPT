Disclaimer! This is not original code. I followed a lecture by Andrej Karpathy who wrote the code. I followed the lecture by writing the code myself and taking notes on my work. 

So I finsihed the video!!! But I am calling it quits so next time what we have to do is this.

1.   Upload what you have done to github âœ…
2.   redo it without the comments in a separate notebook in colab and VS code
3. read the article and right about it on linkedIn
4. make a post about project on linkedIn about
5. Then you are done!


Get started on mirror after that and see if that is possible! You are killing it first summer project is almost done :)
